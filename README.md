## General info
This game introduces us to Dante's servers, which need to be protected from evil UL students, as well as in the game there are civilians who want to go home in peace - you can't kill them! You lose when the bots reach Dante's servers!
This game was written entirely in C, using the SDL library to implement graphics, music, and user interaction. Paint, Photoshop and Gimp were used to draw the models. Music was found by Timur, thanks to him!
